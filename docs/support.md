# Support â€“ Collage Maker

- General support: https://github.com/Jordan-Ryan/Swatchboard/issues
- Troubleshooting steps:
  - Grant Photos permission when prompted
  - To export, tap Export in the editor; the image saves to Photos
  - If exports fail, ensure iOS Settings > Privacy > Photos > Collage Maker is set to Allow

If you need help, open a GitHub issue with your device model and iOS version.
